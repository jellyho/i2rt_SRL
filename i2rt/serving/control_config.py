"""Global control config shared by the teleop / DAgger / replay pipeline.

The **follower's control gains** must be identical wherever the follower is driven
— teleop, DAgger, and replay (via the wrapper) — so a replayed episode behaves
exactly like the collected one. By default they are the arm's ``yam.yml`` gains
(already global); set the overrides here to change them in **one place**.

Steady-state following is intentionally **not** rate-limited: the follower tracks
the leader directly via these gains, matching the original ``minimum_gello``. The
ramp speed below only shapes the one-time engage approach and the homing return.
