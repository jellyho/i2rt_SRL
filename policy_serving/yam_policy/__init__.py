"""yam_policy — a lightweight, openpi-compatible policy serving layer.

Two sides, both speaking websocket + msgpack-numpy:

* server (heavy env): wrap a policy implementing :class:`BasePolicy` in
  :class:`WebsocketPolicyServer` and run it (see :mod:`yam_policy.serve`).
* client (robot/workstation env): :class:`WebsocketClientPolicy` + optional
  :class:`ActionChunkBroker` to execute action chunks open-loop.

The wire protocol matches openpi exactly, so real openpi checkpoints served with
``openpi`` work against this client, and policies written against
:class:`BasePolicy` can be served by openpi.
